<i>This is a genesis chamber.</i>

488
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,529
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this.

489
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,486
Every child was designed to fulfill
a pre-determined role in our society...

490
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,568
...as a worker...

491
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,969
...a warrior, a leader and so on.

492
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,488
Your mother and I believed Krypton
lost something precious.

493
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,927
The element of choice, of chance.

494
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,602
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something...

495
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,366
...other than what society
had intended for him or her?

496
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,486
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

497
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,282
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

498
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,966
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

499
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,771
That's why we risked so much to save you.

500
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,331
Why didn't you come with me?

501
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,609
We couldn't, Kal.

502
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,641
No matter how much...

503
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,126
...we wanted to.

504
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,648
No matter how much we loved you.

505
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,771
Your mother, Lara, and I...

506
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,129
...were a product of the failures
of our world as much as Zod was...

507
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,044
...tied to its fate.

508

- So I'm alone.
- No.

509
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,766
You're as much a child of Earth now
as you are of Krypton.

510
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,209
You can embody the best of both worlds.

511

A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

512
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,570
The people of Earth
are different from us, it's true.

513
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,724
But, ultimately,
I believe that's a good thing.

514

They won't necessarily
make the same mistakes we did.

515
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,608
Not if you guide them, Kal.

516
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,248
Not if you give them hope.

517
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,842
That's what this symbol means.

518
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,881
The symbol of the house of EI
means hope.

519
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,646
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief...

520
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,805
...in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,808
The trust part comes later.

801
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,491
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

802
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,651
All right. You've got our attention.

803
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,161
What is it you want?

804
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,209
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

805
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,680
SWANWICK:
What makes you think she's here?

806
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,688
Don't play games with me, general.

807
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,965
I'll surrender, but only if you
guarantee Lois's freedom.

808
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,008
LOIS:
<i>Why are you surrendering to Zod?</i>

809
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,841
I'm surrendering to mankind.
There's a difference.

810
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,883
You let them handcuff you?

811
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,041
Wouldn't be much of a surrender
if I resisted.

812
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,608
And if it makes them feel more secure...

813
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,523
...then all the better for it.

814
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,121
What's the S stand for?

815
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,165
(SIGHS)

816
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,324
It's not an <i>S.</i>

817
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,370
On my world it means hope.

818
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,847
Well, here, it's an S.

819
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,405
How about...

820
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,761
...Super...

821
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,047
HAMILTON:
Sir?

822
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,648
- Hi, my name is Dr. E...
SUPERMAN: Emil Hamilton.

823
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,850
I know, I can see your ID tag
in your breast pocket.

824
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,162
Along with a half-eaten roll of Lifesavers.

825
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,641
I can also see the soldiers
in the next room...

826
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,201
...preparing that tranquilizing agent
of yours.

827
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,885
You won't need it.

828
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,209
Sir, you can't expect us
to not take precautions.

829
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,886
You could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

830
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,565
Been here for 33 years, doctor.

831
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,765
- Haven't infected anyone yet.
- That you know of. We have legitimate...

832
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,368
...security concerns. You revealed
your identity to Miss Lane over there.

833
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,601
Why won't you do the same with us?

834
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,881
Let's put our cards on the table here,
general.

835
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,049
You're scared because you can't control me.

836
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,166
You don't, and you never will.

837
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,968
But that doesn't mean I'm your enemy.

838
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,730
Then who is?

839
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,405
Zod?

840
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,445
That's what I'm worried about.

841
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,729
Be that as it may...

842
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,770
...I've been given orders
to hand you over to him.

843
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,889
Do what you have to do, general.

844
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,448
Thank you.

845
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,527
For what?

846
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,290
For believing in me.

847
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,368
Didn't make much difference in the end.

848
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,770
It did to me.

849
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,571
(SONIC BOOM)

850
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,930
They're coming.

851
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,205
You should leave now.

852
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,890
Go, Lois.

853
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,171
FAORA:
Kal-EI.

854
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,728
I'm sub-commander Faora-UI.

855
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,643
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.

856
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,803
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.

857
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,008
General Zod would like this woman...

858
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,890
...to accompany me.

859
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,966
HARDY:
You asked for the alien.

860
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,324
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

861
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,729
Shall I tell the general
you're unwilling to comply?

862
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,849
I don't care what you tell him.

863
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,285
LOIS:
It's all right.

864
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,566
I'll go.

865
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,246
The atmospheric composition on our ship
is not compatible with humans.

866
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,845
You need to wear a breather...

867
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,770
...beyond this point.

868
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:38,842
Kal-EI.

869
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,450
You have no idea how long...

870
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,728
...we've been searching for you.

871
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,201
I take it you're Zod?

872
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,566
General Zod.

873
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,609
- Our commander.
- It's all right, Faora.

874
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,525
We can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.

875
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,683
He's a stranger to our ways.

876
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,007
This should be cause...

877
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,289
...for celebration, not conflict.

878
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,727
SUPERMAN: Unh.
ZOD: Not conflict.

883
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,691
SUPERMAN:
Weak.

884
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,006
LOIS:
What's happening to him?

885
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,811
ZOD:
He's rejecting our ship's atmospherics.

886
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:17,643
LOIS:
Clark.

887
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,565
You've spent a lifetime
adapting to Earth's ecology...

888
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,642
...but never adapted to ours.

889
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,847
Help him.

890
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,650
I can't. Whatever's happening...

891
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,121
- ...has to run its course.

893
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,766
Help him.

894
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,721
Help him.

895
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,930
ZOD:
Hello, Kal.

896
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,641
Or do you prefer Clark?

897
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,771
That's the name they gave you.

898
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,286
Isn't it?

899
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,284
I was Krypton's military leader...

900
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,961
...your father our foremost scientist.

901
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,645
The only thing we agreed on...

902
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,645
...was that Krypton was dying.
In return for my efforts...

903
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,451
...to protect our civilization...

904
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,762
...and save our planet...

905
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,050
...I and my fellow officers
were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

906
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,243
ZOD:
<i>And then the destruction of our world...</i>

907
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,005
<i>...freed us.</i>

908
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,687
<i>We were adrift, destined to float...</i>

909

<i>...amongst the ruins of our planet...</i>

910
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,969
<i>...until we starved.</i>

<i>How did you find your way to Earth?</i>

912
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:41,205
ZOD: <i>We managed to retrofit</i>
<i>the phantom projector into a hyperdrive.</i>

913
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,883
<i>Your father made a similar modification
to the craft that brought you here.</i>

914
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,003
<i>And so the instrument of our damnation...</i>

915
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,844
<i>...became our salvation.</i>

916
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,326
<i>We sought out the old colonial outposts...</i>

917
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,801
<i>...looking for signs of life.</i>

918
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,050
<i>But all we found was death.</i>

919
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,646
<i>Cut off from Krypton, these outposts...</i>

920
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,087
<i>...withered and died long ago.</i>

921
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,568
<i>We salvaged what we could...</i>

922
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,529
<i>...armor, weapons...</i>

923
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,683
<i>...even a world engine.</i>

924
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,329
<i>For 33 years we prepared...</i>

925
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,565
<i>...until finally we detected
a distress beacon...</i>

926
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,609
<i>...which you triggered...</i>

927
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,081
<i>...when you accessed
the ancient scout ship.</i>

928
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:38,051
You led us here, Kal.

929
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,491
Now it's within your power...

930
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,361
...to save what remains of your race.

931
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,360
On Krypton...

932
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,251
...the genetic template
for every being yet to be born...

933
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,051
...is encoded in the registry of citizens.

934
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,848
Your father stole the registry's Codex...

935
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,924
...and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

936
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,482
For what purpose?

937
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,291
So that Krypton can live again...

938
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,690
...on Earth.

939
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,602
Where is the Codex, Kal?

940
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,123
If Krypton lives again...

941
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,691
...what happens to Earth?

942
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:42,202
The foundation has to be
built on something.

943
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,245
Even your father recognized that.

944
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,007
No, Zod.

945
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,406
I can't be a part of this.

946
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,924
Then what can you be a part of?

947
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,726
No!

01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,962
...himself with honor, Kal.

955
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,808
You killed him?

01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,525
I did.

- Mm-hm. Yes, sir.

1443
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:26,569
MARTHA: He always believed
you were meant for greater things.

1444
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,325
And that when the day came...

1445
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:31,370
...your shoulders would be able
to bear the weight.

1446
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:35,446
Yeah, I just wish he could have
been here to see it finally happen.

1447
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:37,888
He saw it, Clark, believe me.

1448
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:28,204
MARTHA: <i>What are you going to do</i>
<i>when you're not saving the world?</i>

1449
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:32,166
- Have you given any thought to that?
- I have, actually. Heh, heh.

1450
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:37,805
I gotta find a job
where I can keep my ear to the ground.

1451
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:45,122
CLARK:
<i>Where people won't look twice...</i>

1452
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:49,160
<i>...when I want to go somewhere dangerous
and start asking questions.</i>

1453
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:00,330
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

1454
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:06,289
Come on, Lois.
When are you gonna throw me a bone?

1455
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:09,210
Courtside seats to the game tonight.

1456
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:11,205
- What do you say?
- I say...

1457
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:14,006
...you should go back
to trolling the intern pool.

1458
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:17,642
You'll probably have more luck. Sorry.

1459
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:20,089
Courtside?

1460
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:22,044
LOIS: Don't. Ha, ha, ha.
- No.

1461
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:25,130
Lombard, Lane,
I want you to meet our new stringer.

1462
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:28,569
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.

1463
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,131
Good luck, kid.

1464
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:32,926
LOMBARD:
Hey. Steve.

1465
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:34,400
- Nice to meet you.
LOMBARD: You too.

1466
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:35,482
LOIS:
Hi.

1467
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:37,765
Lois Lane.

1468
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:40,130
Welcome to the <i>Planet.</i>

1469
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:45,848
CLARK: Glad to be here, Lois.
