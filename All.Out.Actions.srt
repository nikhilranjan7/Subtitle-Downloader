1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,098
ZACK: I knew there'd be a lot of action and I knew
that we were gonna see Superman fight.

2
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:23,440
TWIGHT: It's a must for any type of action film like this
to have your physical training...

3
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,734
...as well as the stunt training.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,111
Because they're each
gonna complement each other.

5
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,783
We're gonna go through this process...

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,371
...because we know it's not only important
to the physical aesthetic and how they look...

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,082
...but it's important
for their character development.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,045
DEBORAH: Like all of our films,
there's a great deal of physicality...

9
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:50,050
...and we've always believed in not just
preparing the body, but it's also a state of mind.

10
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,718
It has to embody everything you do.

11
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:56,640
So we worked again with Mark Twight
from Gym Jones who we worked with on 300.

12
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,060
I love, you know,
the sort of Gym Jonesian approach.

13
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:05,857
And I love Mark's approach to the actors
and their characters and the physicality.

14
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:10,529
It's like a triad all combined.
And the training, in a weird way...

15
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,656
...is a meditation on those things.

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,325
TWIGHT:
The wonderful thing about a superhero...

17
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,787
...is all you gotta do to look at the physique
you need to produce...

18
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,332
...is open a comic book
and there it is.

19
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:27,212
To live up to that iconic ideal
was not an easy task.

20
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,008
Mark's fantastic. He understands the diet
and the mindset.

21
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:36,013
He was tasked with bringing Henry
from human status to superhuman status.

22
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,681
Henry was game from the get-go.

23
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,851
TWIGHT: For Henry's journey on this job,
I met him for the first time...

24
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,145
...and basically asked questions.

25
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,522
I tried to get, you know,
a handle on his character...

26
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,776
...a little bit of his training background,
his sort of lifestyle background.

27
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,029
That allowed me to write a training plan...

28
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,990
...that he followed
for the entire duration that we expected.

29
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,869
CAVILL: Mark, probably one of
the most incredible people I've met.

30
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:02,956
The things he has helped me achieve--
I can only speak for myself, really.

31
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:08,420
But he's opened my eyes
to seeing past what I thought were my limits.

32
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:14,760
And the ability to crush me in the gym,
just enough that I can't walk out properly...

33
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,139
...and I feel horrible and feel a little sick
but I still want to come back.

34
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:23,310
It's not easy for anyone,
but that doesn't mean that it was painful.

35
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,938
Obviously, there were times
where he was cursing me under his breath...

36
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,858
...sometimes to my face,
but it's expected.

37
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:33,528
Having it be difficult, I think,
makes the end result worthwhile.

38
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,366
ROVEN:
Henry's work to get his body in shape...

39
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,577
...also just evolved into...

40
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:45,374
...getting his mind and spirit into shape.

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,294
TWIGHT: One of the strongest connections
that I saw not only with our gym...

42
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:54,591
...but with Henry and the idea of Superman
was that he's given this great power by birth...

43
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:59,638
...and with that comes this responsibility
to develop values, to live by a code.

44
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,932
Henry's journey was quite similar in a way.

45
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,103
CAVILL: One hundred percent, the training
has been a journey of discovery...

46
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,522
...just like Superman's journey of discovery.

47
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,940
Superman learned he could fly.

48
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,111
I learned I could do all sorts of things
in the gym which I never thought possible.

49
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:19,825
TWIGHT: He started out--
I think his deadlift was about 245 pounds.

50
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,536
After a period of time, he pulled 435.

51
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,664
And it all came from hard work
and discipline...

52
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,792
...and paying attention to his diet
and to his sleep and to his recovery.

53
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,380
And ultimately,
I think Henry Cavill is Superman.

54
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,259
ROVEN: Mark Twight has worked
with all of the Kryptonians.

55
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:42,097
The Kryptonians are a very physical
and physically fit race.

56
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,517
And we needed to make sure that
whether it was General Zod...

57
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,229
...or his number one sub commander, Faora...

58
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:54,025
...that they were all really
pretty amazing specimens.

59
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,363
A lot of the first week with Mark,
we talked more than anything else.

60
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,032
Their philosophy
about why they do what they do...

61
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,411
...and why it's important
is much more convincing...

62
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,788
...than anything I've heard anywhere else.

63
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,498
TWIGHT:
He started to get it and he was like:

64
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,918
"Wow, this is cool. Now I get it.
It's time to get serious."

65
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,629
I mean, he would just kill himself
and then rest long enough...

66
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,341
...to decide that it was okay,
that he really wanted to go again.

67
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,552
SHANNON:
You know, people, they like to talk about it...

68
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:25,557
...in terms of how it's going to be extreme
or torturous or whatever...

69
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,602
...but I never really found it
to be their approach.

70
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,147
I never felt like they asked me
to do anything I couldn't do.

71
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,940
TWIGHT:
With Antje, she wasn't fit...

72
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,610
...from our point of view,
but she had taken care of herself.

73
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,363
And she came from a sport background having
done gymnastics when she was younger...

74
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,574
...so she moved well,
she knew how to use her body.

75
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,119
And that gave her quite a bit of advance
in terms of teachability.

76
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:53,251
Two hours with Gym Jones
is basically work hard and confront yourself.

77
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,173
Everything you do in these two hours
needs absolute 100 percent of your focus.

78
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,801
So the gym, you know,
there are no televisions...

79
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,386
...there are no newspapers
or whatever distracts you.

80
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,140
You find yourself in front of a bar
with 215 pounds...

81
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,684
...and of course you're naturally scared...

82
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,647
...like, you know, injuring yourself
or failing or whatever.

83
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:18,026
But I also wanted to feel Faora's powers,
right, and not just imagine them.

84
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,779
So I knew, okay, I should go for it.

85
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,865
She became this person
she wanted to become.

86
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,660
And she noticed the effects
of working in the gym day after day...

87
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,162
...working very hard with stunts...

88
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,291
...and her character development
and dieting very, very hard.

89
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,503
TRAUE: Eventually, you come to a point
where your mind...

90
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,506
...allows you to break through
your physical boundaries...

91
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,009
...and takes you to places
where you think you could never go to.

92
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:49,391
And when that happens, it's a great feeling.
I have to say it's almost addictive.

93
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,434
TWIGHT: For me, functional training
means transferrable.

94
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,687
That means that the training
I do in the gym...

95
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,565
...improves my ability to do the actual tasks.

96
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,735
For Henry, you know, learning to move
his body not only in the gym...

97
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:05,782
...but also in the stunt training
was what gave him the capability to do that.

98
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:10,453
SHANNON: Even though you never
really see my actual body in the movie...

99
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,624
...I'm playing someone
who is very physically capable.

100
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,379
Obviously, it affects the way you move
and just your physical presence.

101
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,381
TWIGHT:
Mike Shannon takes acting very seriously.

102
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,758
And it shows in his character.
He's constantly thinking.

103
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,845
And to bring that into the actual fighting
and the conflict that he has...

104
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:31,016
...in a way that's not just character-driven
or emotion-driven...

105
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,726
...but also has a physical component.

106
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,229
BLEVINS: We have hands in kind of
how they developed their character.

107
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:41,318
The discussions during warm-ups and
cool-downs was how to express a character.

108
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:45,906
In Henry's case,
that silent strength comes out very well.

109
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,326
In Michael Shannon's case,
it was how a general acts.

110
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,788
You see his posture change in mentioning
to him about how a general would act.

111
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,083
If they have to express power
through their attitude...

112
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,254
...and their shoulder and their posture,
it's usually, you know, very, very subtle.

113
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,340
Antje in the same way, one day...

114
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:08,011
...she came in before shooting and I believe
she had to throw somebody through a ceiling.

115
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,014
To see her pick something up
off the ground heavy...

116
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:15,977
...and then go shoot this scene, those things
definitely have to do with the character.

117
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:20,357
TRAUE: Working out and lifting weights
made me experience that there's beauty...

118
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,152
...to physical strength
and fearlessness and power.

119
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,822
And it actually became
a very important pillar to approach...

120
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,784
...to play a female superhuman character.

121
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,370
Because they were all doing it together...

122
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,830
...and because they knew
what the pain was like...

123
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,667
...it was this kind of camaraderie.

124
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,543
TWIGHT:
You put an actor in the situation where:

125
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,797
"Hey, if you live up to this role,
if you are believable in this role...

126
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,675
...you're gonna be the guy,
you're gonna be the next guy."

127
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,468
CAVILL:
He keeps it constantly evolving...

128
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,304
...as not just a physical thing,
but a psychological thing as well.

129
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,599
He's just someone who understands
what I'm going through physically...

130
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,185
...which I think is what makes him
such a good trainer.

131
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,145
He sees your breaking point
about to happen...

132
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,564
...then he'll either push you
past that breaking point...

133
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:06,987
...or he'll push you right up to the edge
of that precipice and then hold you back.

134
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,906
I wish I could have been a fly on the wall
watching him work...

135
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,660
...because he's a remarkable man, truly.
And I have so much respect for him.

136
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,454
It's a cool way to make a movie.
It's a cool way to get someone...

137
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,373
...to do something that they've never done.

138
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,168
And I think that that's what Mark
loves to get at and kind of mess with.

139
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,922
To take these people
who've chosen to be actors...

140
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,843
...who experience emotion in a way
where they're analyzing it as they do it...

141
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,596
I think for him,
those guys in the gym are really interesting...

142
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:38,935
...because pain and fear, success and joy,
all those things are present. It's there.

143
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,563
And with an actor,
the reward of the suffering...

144
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,901
...is really evident.
And you bring that to the movie. It's fun.

145
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,946
CAVILL: It's not the kind of training
which just makes you look pretty.

146
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,867
It's the kind of training which,
first and foremost, is useful.

147
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:59,414
I didn't realize, like, how difficult
the stuff that I was doing was...

148
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,499
...but because I trained with Gym Jones...

149
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,502
...I'd been given that, at the very least,
core strength.

150
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,671
CARO:
Any type of action, any type of stunt work...

151
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,841
...specifically wire work,
you need a strong core...

152
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,427
...and you need your muscles
to be lengthened...

153
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,638
...you need them to be strong,
and you need to be stable.

154
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,684
If you don't have muscle to hold that together,
you can get injured.

155
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,812
So being in shape
is an enormous advantage.

156
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,315
In terms of the action,
that was something Zack said:

157
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,442
"I want some really great action."

158
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,570
He has these powers
and what would it be like...

159
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,157
...when he's fighting another Kryptonian
who has the same kind of powers?

160
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,036
CARO:
Flying was one of many attributes...

161
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:42,707
...that we had to really, really take our time
to figure out. How do we do this correctly?

162
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,211
We went from wire rigs to gimbal rigs...

163
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,089
...where we had more of a base plate.
You name it, we explored it.

164
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,926
Thanks to D.J., there's a tremendous
amount of takeover with CG...

165
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,303
...but we still do
what's called a performance capture...

166
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,305
...where we fly our guys on wires...

167
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:02,310
...and D.J. uses that base movement and
builds over it to give it that human connection.

168
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,814
You're gonna see Superman fly faster
than ever before.

169
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,443
It's hard to come up with those speeds.

170
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,154
CARO: Zack and I would sit down
and come up with a scale...

171
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,533
...so we have some sort of rules, a playbook,
some guidelines, foundation...

172
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,785
...to go, "Okay, let's try
and not violate these."

173
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,913
Then he has, like, a riot with this.

174
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,084
Exactly. I mean, it's more about pressure
than it is about pain, yeah.

175
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,628
So basically we take that as a reference...

176
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:33,341
...and we built all the physics around the action
to see if it makes sense or not.

177
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:37,720
Most movies have three elements
you have to achieve throughout the movie.

178
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,682
And this one has, you know,
11, 12 giant sequences.

179
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,520
Thought it was just impossible to make
but it was gonna be great if we could pull it off.

180
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,314
CAVILL: I think the way that
the fights are different in this movie...

181
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,944
...is the super-speed aspect,
making it completely superhuman...

182
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,447
...and beyond the scope
of what is actually humanly possible.

183
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,368
And I think that's what makes these
particularly exciting...

184
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,495
...because anything can happen...

185
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:07,041
...and what the imagination allows
does happen in this.

186
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,588
WHIST:
There's the handoff between visual effects...

187
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,090
...and then picking the moments when
you put them in...

188
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,677
...and have real stuff happen.
For instance, the oil rig.

189
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,268
You see him more as a human
in that element...

190
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,938
...because he hasn't got the Superman outfit
on yet. He's just a guy.

191
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,442
But he's this guy who happens to be able
to walk through fire...

192
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,985
...and have nothing happen to him.

193
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,779
GRISPO:
Henry's very good at physical things.

194
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:42,660
Having an actor that has natural talent
to perform action is always a bonus.

195
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,162
MAN:
Go.

196
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:51,544
GRISPO: Our challenge is always to make
the actor do the most of his physical abilities...

197
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,297
...of course, without asking them
to do anything too crazy.

198
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,009
The most you see the actor
performing their own stunts and action...

199
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,012
...the more rewarding it is for us.

200
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,186
CROWE: It's an incredibly good collection
of stunt people on this film.

201
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:12,023
There's a level of commitment that
something like this takes.

202
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,858
And that goes all the way through.

203
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,486
Russell was great because
he had the physical ability before...

204
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,071
...so he knew what he was good at.

205
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,783
So he had a little more input
in the style and the performance.

206
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,244
He brought a lot to the table
with experience in action.

207
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,248
In the Genesis Chamber,
he's swimming through a tunnel.

208
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,125
DESJARDIN: It's supposed to be this
very watery, amniotic-fluid environment...

209
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,544
...and how else do you do that
but submerse somebody?

210
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,547
We talked for a while
about should we hang him from wires...

211
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,342
...and blow some wind
and shoot him at high speed?

212
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,636
But the style of the movie is handheld,
it's real...

213
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,972
...so we wanted the real physics
of what that would be.

214
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:49,143
CROWE: You have to submerge yourself 15 feet
and then kick off from a certain point...

215
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,230
...and then travel 60, 7O feet underwater...

216
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,483
...sometimes going through
specific motions...

217
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,280
...and then return up to the top.
It's a big breath required, you know?

218
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,866
It was super crowded down there.
You got camera guys, you got focus pullers.

219
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,577
ROMANO: We had underwater electricians,
underwater grips.

220
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,288
Because this tank was rigged...

221
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,834
...like I've never seen a tank rigged before.
The amount of lights...

222
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,255
And I think at our disposal here
we have close to 700,000 watts of light.

223
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,383
RIGBY: And then you've got people down
below, need to be mindful of their bubbles.

224
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,303
And they have to hold their breath
when cameras are rolling.

225
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,554
It's not very pleasant.

226
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,600
Pete and myself did a lot of head scratching
about how we could get the shot.

227
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,185
And seemingly it seems quite simple.

228
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,439
He just needs to be floating there,
motionless in the water...

229
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,358
...but we had flames
above the surface of the water.

230
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,197
You never wanna tie anybody underwater when
you're gonna remove the regulator from them.

231
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,160
Henry would naturally float feet down
and then he would sink.

232
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,579
So had to have lines from his feet...

233
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,581
...up to just below the surface, in fact.

234
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,959
We couldn't go above the surface because
flames were gonna go above the surface.

235
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,712
So we had to go as high as we could,
but tie below the surface.

236
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:03,009
And then he had just loops around his fingers
so he could still have this Jesus pose.

237
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,179
Then I would just have to leave him
with all the guys holding their breath...

238
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,598
...because they're shooting up
and bubbles can't be in it.

239
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:14,979
The danger, of course, in that is if Henry went
to the surface as the propane blast went off.

240
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,692
You just sink down,
you're holding your breath...

241
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,029
...and you're doing whatever you need to do
for the camera, which you can't see.

242
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,697
And I had this wonderful moment...

243
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,826
...ofjust taking a few deep, slow breaths
and then dropping down.

244
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:33,623
And all of a sudden, all I could hear
was my heart.

245
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:39,045
And it was peaceful and quiet
and I was down there for ages.

246
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,882
And I just felt like I could just keep on holding
my breath, everything slowed down.

247
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,636
And as a contrast, all the work we're doing
and then how rushed everything is here.

248
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,388
And how sort of frenetic the energy is.

249
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:55,144
It was nice to just have that peaceful moment.
And I never expected that to happen.

250
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,313
It's something I will not forget.

251
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,774
It's probably one of the lasting memories
from this job...

252
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:04,153
...that moment of peace,
which I found just underwater.

253
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,990
CARO: Anytime we're working with
an actor or a stunt person...

254
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:12,912
...everyone brings their own God-given talent
and attributes to a particular project.

255
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,541
When Zack and I are creating
the styles in the laboratory...

256
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,335
...before we get to actually
even sometimes hire the actors...

257
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:24,340
...we have an understanding of how
we want each person to move stylistically.

258
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,176
On Krypton, they're a military culture.

259
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,013
So we looked at that and go, "Okay, what do
we--? What sort of basis do we wanna give?"

260
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,976
And we mixed some Chinese methods,
Filipino methods.

261
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,310
A little bit of basic boxing.

262
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:41,315
But we kind of tried to create this little hybrid
that hadn't really been seen before.

263
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,026
Not radically different than other styles
we've created before...

264
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,320
...but just to give it a little flavor of its own.

265
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,784
WATSON: We first have to see what they're
good at and then make the decision:

266
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,538
"Okay, do I wanna try to push them to a level
that, say, might not be natural...

267
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,290
...or go with what they're good at?"

268
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,625
So Antje had good lines, really good fluidity...

269
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:04,630
...so we kind of made her style a female version
of the Kryptonian form of martial arts.

270
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,924
For the fight geeks out there,
they're gonna notice...

271
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,510
...that the guys from Krypton
all do similar movements.

272
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,846
Faora has a move, like a palm slap.

273
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,599
Which, on Krypton, would be
like a right hook or something.

274
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,518
But on Earth, I mean,
it would disintegrate a human body.

275
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:21,397
So she throws that slap with, you know, power,
and Zod'll do the same thing.

276
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,691
But they both have different styles.

277
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,402
Michael Shannon was really good
with straight movements...

278
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,531
...so we kind of made his moves were a little
more straight blasts and more direct stuff.

279
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:36,496
So we had to come up with a movement form
for each of them that kind of fit their storyline.

280
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,915
Henry could pretty much
do anything you showed him.

281
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:43,252
His character, Superman, he doesn't
know this Kryptonian martial arts form.

282
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:49,467
So you almost had to take Henry's crispness
and clean lines and training out of it...

283
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,720
...to give him the frat boy, haymaker,
if you will.

284
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,556
So that was kind of fun, just telling him
to open his moves up.

285
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,769
Big strikes and heavy blows
because he's a superly-- A power base.

286
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,648
Zod had more of a strategic style to him
so it makes for a good fight.

287
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,026
ZACK: We knew this was a broader
challenge conceptually...

288
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,737
...because Superman can't do anything
that's not a visual effect.

289
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:14,784
He can't just grab a thing and move it
without it being a visual effect.

290
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,410
He doesn't move it at our scale.

291
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,955
GRISPO:
Zack likes to draw his own boards...

292
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,999
...so we take that,
we design the action around it...

293
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,587
...and then we shoot our rehearsals
in a cinematic way.

294
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:31,676
We build the whole sequence as you're
gonna potentially see it on the screen.

295
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,969
We know the running times...

296
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:37,056
...and we know if the timing of the action
is gonna work out in the end or not.

297
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:41,102
We do stunt vis to figure out all the beats,
create the action...

298
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,687
...get everyone on the same page...

299
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:47,191
...so we have a much clearer vision
when we actually get on set to shoot it.

300
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,901
They show us the entire fight scene.

301
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,738
They say, "This is what it's supposed to look
like." Obviously in a very, very basic version.

302
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,866
"And this is the one piece we're doing here."

303
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,370
And that did make it a lot easier.
Otherwise we'd be a little bit lost, I think.

304
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,290
Because when you're in a green room
doing a whole bunch of punches...

305
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,084
...thinking, "Am I on the side of a building,
am I upside down...

306
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,088
...am I in space,
am I flying through a building?"

307
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,590
The previs helps with that.

308
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,884
I love it. It lets me know the world
I'm walking into.

309
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:18,681
And it lets me know how they see these action
sequences from an emotional point of view.

310
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,184
It lets me know the moments
they're looking to capture.

(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

312
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,691
A lot of Illinois was dominated
by the battle of Smallville.

313
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,403
Which is a big military operation
in the small town.

MAN:
Back. Get back!

315
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,325
WILSON:
A lot of complexities involved with that.

316
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:42,204
Lot of action, lot of stunts, live fire, helicopters,
the whole shebang.

317
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:46,917
I mean, it's a monster. I don't think
I've ever seen an action scene that's this big.

(INAUDIBLE)

319
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,344
And we shot it in two weeks.

320
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,307
So that was probably the hardest scene to
come up with, just because of the size of it.

321
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,477
When we did the battle of Smallville...

322
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:09,065
...we used part of what existed and then we
built our own buildings and destroyed them.

(MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

324
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,784
We put pieces of airplane parts...

325
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,827
...and we lit these enormous fires...

326
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,039

than we've ever done things before.

ZACK: When it dips and the guns start firing,
it's gonna come forward.

328
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,590
Yes, it is.

- Damn it.
-I know.

330
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,260
Couldn't we get those helicopters
that don't do that?

331
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,388
- Tell them you can do that?
-Damn physics.

332
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:47,561
We probably shot 95 percent of it
on the actual streets.

333
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,188
Couple beats we shot on green screen.

334
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,441
But the majority of that
was live action on location.

335
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,194
As much as we can do practically
is always better.

Say, "This is what's gonna happen:..

340
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,707
...with one of us in that situation,
so he knows what's gonna happen.

341
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:13,129
He knows that we've already done it,
that we've got his best interests at heart.

342
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,385
That's when we started coming up
with how fast Superman flies.

343
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,851
They really had to plan out every move...

344
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:31,731
...and what was gonna be shot practically
and what we were gonna be doing digitally.

345
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,277
David and I sat down and said, "Oh, yeah,
we'll be able to photograph these pieces...

346
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,779
...but there's these other pieces
that we can't photograph."

347
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,245
So we either had to use wires...

348
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:52,126
...or a lot of times we've done
this physical-to-CG handoff...

...where we'll start out
and it's actually really Henry...

...and then all of a sudden
when he goes into the air...

351
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,346
...or he makes a really fast move,
we turned him into CG...

352
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,433
...and then we put him back
to the real Henry again.

353
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,268
You Okay?

354
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,523
We wanna keep as much real as possible.
Peflod.

355
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,486
You know, we wanna see the nuances
of the face and when the hair blow by.

356
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,905
And, you know, the cape.
We wanna be in there.

357
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,907
We wanna be in it,
we wanna be over the action.

358
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,035
We wanna constantly push back
the digital hand-off.

359
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,537
And as long as we can push that
and keep that real...

360
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:34,168
...then visual effects is not taking over, visual
effects is assisting what we're trying to do.

361
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:38,756
And we're trying to keep it as real as possible
to the last possible moment.

362
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,802
We wanted to able to have these guys
really do some of the moves...

363
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,805
...so that when we get to the pauses
in the fight...

364
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,309
...or the moments where your eye
is gonna dwell on them, it's really them.

365
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:55,231
The other authentic thing that Zack
wanted and really paid off...

366
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:59,151
...was that all the soldiers in the scenes
are real soldiers and airmen.

They're not Central Casting extras.

368
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,366
I think every one of them had deployed at least
once or twice, either Iraq or Afghanistan.

369
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,410
They knew how to put on the equipment,
they knew how to hold the guns...

370
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,540
...and they knew how to be authentic
because they were the real deal.

371
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,376
Zack is awesome, outstanding.

372
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,253
He respects the military.

373
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:22,258
He gets out there and talks to each one
of the soldiers or the airmen and it's great.

One of the big fights that we did
takes place in Metropolis.

379
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:45,865
Zack said, "You know, I envision this
to be a barroom brawl on a larger scale."

380
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,076
As opposed to picking up a beer bottle
and whacking the guy over the head...

381
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,661
...maybe he picks up an I beam.

382
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,332
To shoot a stunt vis for that was challenging.
We basically had some wire moves.

383
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,210
Some walking and talking blocking.

384
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,130
Mixed together with more visual effects previs
for that...

385
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,924

the battle being all in the air.

flipping each other...

...but never landing on the ground,
just continually rolling around...

389
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,436
...and creating this intense, aggressive fight.

They're able to stay in one spot, hover...

393
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,447
...and then they can switch positions real fast.

394
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:30,451
So we wanted to come up with this fight
that they're all going around each other.

395
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,620
Now, it's easy to come up with it
in our heads...

in which these two characters do.

and not rip them apart or blow something.

fights that people talk about for years to come.

402

I'm not the type of actor
that goes to the monitor usually.

403
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,111
Particularly if I'm doing a scene,
I would never go, I don't wanna see it.

404
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,908
But in this kind of work when you're just
trying to get each little movement correct...

405
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,953
...I'm actually very critical of it.

406
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,747
Inevitably, it never looks the way that it felt.

407
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,250
You can do something
and it feels very full-on...

408
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,878
...and then you go look at it
and it seems kind of flat.

409
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,506
And you realize that
there's a lot of technique at play.

410
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:29,718
And it's just about angles
and how your body moves.

411
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,637
Great, let's do it tighter, very nice.

412
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:35,349
And that's what Zack and Damon
especially do very, very well.

413
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:38,602
It's like these two gods, basically,
fighting over the city.

414
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,940
Causing destruction, but mainly
taking each other out, you know...

415
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,235
...that's what you wanna get.
That's your payoff at the end as a fan.

416
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,784
It's been great fun working with the guys.
Doing the wire work for hours on end.

417
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:57,454
There's a lot to be said for it
because you get to fly. Ha, ha.

418
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,790
And that is fun.

419

When you're doing something
which is physically taxing...

420

...and all around tricky to do...

421
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,353
...because it's so new...

422
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,107
...it makes it that much easier when you've got
guys who are actually enjoying it with you.
